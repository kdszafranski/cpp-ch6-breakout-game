# My C++ Breakout

![My Breakout](pictures/udemy-boost-screenie.png)

## About 

Challenge: Given the engine so far, make a game, any game. Keep it simple.

I chose to make a simple form of Breakout.

Features:

* game loop (initialization, input, render)
* collision detection
* simple game logic - ball resets if missed, blocks disappear when hit

Time: about 10 hours

Book: [Programming 2D Games by Charles Kelly](http://www.programming2dgames.com//)


## Learnings

I'll note that the content is quite old (circa 2012) so I had to convert the code in the book and examples a bit to get it working on Windows 10. The biggest challenge was getting all the DirectX9 parts needed set up in the includes and linker settings.

* I have solid understanding of all the pieces fit together in this engine and the things that need to be accounted for in any game engine
* I can see how the organization of the components so far will be serious problems on a project that is much larger than this tiny game


## Proud Of

I'm proud of working through 2 blocking type bugs which stopped me in my tracks. But I kept at it and worked passed them. I could easily take this further but need to move on.
